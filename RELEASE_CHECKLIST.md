## Match workflow

- [ ] Create, edit, and remove a test team/player; verify every removal asks for confirmation
- [ ] Create matches using 3v3, 5v5, 8v8, and 11v11 presets
- [ ] Confirm every offered formation matches the selected team size

- [ ] Create squad and lineup
- [ ] Long-press and drag players bench→pitch, pitch→pitch, and pitch→bench

## Camera and storage

- [ ] Force-stop during recording and verify the segment is marked interrupted

- [ ] Play timeline-linked clips and previous/next events

## Backup and restore

- [ ] Create a password-encrypted `.mrbak` backup without videos
- [ ] Save through local storage and at least one installed cloud document provider
- [ ] Restore onto a clean installation and compare teams, players, matches, events, and minutes
- [ ] Confirm a wrong password and a damaged file leave existing data unchanged
- [ ] Confirm restore requires destructive-action confirmation
- [ ] Confirm restore is blocked during an active match or recording
- [ ] Create an opt-in backup with videos and verify restored clips play
- [ ] Confirm unavailable media is reported as a warning rather than silently omitted
- [ ] Confirm the password is recorded securely outside the backup; there is no password recovery

## Privacy, export, and deletion

- [ ] Export CSV and open it in a spreadsheet application
- [ ] Export the PDF match summary and verify details, timeline, minutes, recordings,
      review notes, and privacy notice
- [ ] Confirm player names, events, minutes, and recording references are correct

- [ ] Confirm an imported source video remains on the device

- [ ] Test portrait and landscape layouts
- [ ] Verify colour is not the only indicator of state
- [ ] Verify every destructive action requires confirmation
- [ ] Check the launcher icon with round, squircle, and Android themed-icon settings
- [ ] Confirm launcher-icon pitch lines and play symbol remain legible at small sizes

## Usability passes 26–35

- [ ] Complete the match-day readiness check and follow each warning back to lineup editing
- [ ] Swap bench↔pitch and pitch↔pitch players; verify both positions and states persist
- [ ] Verify Summary, Timeline, Video, and Data review sections retain their state
- [ ] Filter squad members by availability and confirm unavailable players cannot be selected
- [ ] Search matches by opponent, team, venue, and competition
- [ ] Select a match date with the date picker and verify the stored `yyyy-MM-dd` value
- [ ] Compare backup estimates with videos enabled and disabled
- [ ] Test imported video from a provider that grants and refuses persistable URI access
- [ ] Deny camera permission permanently and verify **Open app settings** recovery
- [ ] Test bottom navigation and Back icon with TalkBack

## Reliability passes 36–45

- [ ] Review a match with an intentionally inconsistent score and confirm the integrity warning appears
- [ ] Rapidly repeat goal, clock, and substitution controls; confirm duplicate commands are suppressed
- [ ] Change wall-clock time during an active clock test and confirm the recovery warning appears
- [ ] Open a match containing stale or invalid recording metadata and confirm the recording warning appears
